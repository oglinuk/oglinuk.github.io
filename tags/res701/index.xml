      <description>Research 701 ~ Credibility How can something be credible? Both the oxford dictionary and merriam-webster define credibility as &amp;ldquo;the quality of being believable&amp;rdquo; [source 1] [source 2] This to me is rather dangerous, since things like vaccine hesitancy have gained traction in recent years. This stems from social platforms giving an amplified voice to those who are not credible, but are accepted as credible by others using the social platform(s) for their source(s) of information.</description>

      <description>Research 701 ~ Paradigms Postmodernism is a word that I have heard people like Jordan Peterson use but is not a word that I never investigated. It just so happens that postmodernism is one of the paradigms that we talked about in class. The other paradigms are classical and social. One of the take homes is to choose one of the paradigms, describe it, explain what it can be used for, and why I like/dislike the paradigm.</description>

      <description>Today in class the tutor had a set of questions that he wanted us to break up into groups and answer. Reflecting on these questions has only increased the amount questions rather than provide truthful or even a slightly understandable answers. In saying that they are also extremely interesting questions that have a much deeper meaning than anyone could ever percieve or come to understand. These are the answers that resulted after refined discussion internally and with the group I was with.</description>

      <description>Research 701 ~ Day 0 Res701 is another required class for my bachelor of IT course. This class is based around academic research, where we look at/review academic papers/research methodologies and write blogs about them. Blogs have never been my strong point so I am going to put 110% effort into ensuring consistentcy for this class. I already know what area I am going to be focusing on (data science, machine learning and deep learning), so in that regard I am already ahead of the curve.</description>
